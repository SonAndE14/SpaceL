            <h3>¡More information about the Project!</h3>
            
            <p>¡A great idea is Born!</p>
            
            <p>Spaceland is a server where you can find games and lots of fun. Besides that, it is surrounded by a proactive community that advances every day, in addition to that we have ongoing projects that advance every day.</p>
            
            <p>The idea of Spaceland like many was born being something vasio that did not matter, but an IdolsTheLunar person decided to start this great project.</p>
          
        <p>Spaceland started its project on 4/27/2021 on its first platform, Discord, as always not everything can be rosy, it started with too many mistakes and without a good staff, of course it should be expected, since no project starts being great, little by little it was advancing</p>
        
        <p>A month later, it already had staff and a few users, but the truth is that many thought that the project would die without being started. But soon everything changed</p>
        
        <p>Spaceland, had a great change, was updated and arrived full of fun, all this was possible thanks to the help of its staff, who never gave up, and decided to move the project forward.</p>
        
        <p>Nowadays it is a stable server full of direction, besides it has an active team that offers security at all times, feel at home and enjoy the comforts we offer. I hope you like it!</p>
        
        <p>Thank you very much for reading our Story</p>
